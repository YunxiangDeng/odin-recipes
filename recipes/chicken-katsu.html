  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  <p>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour,
    beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken
    breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press into
    panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.
  </p>
  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  <p>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot
    oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a
    paper towel-lined plate to drain.
