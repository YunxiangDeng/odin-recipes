<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
</p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Whisk flour, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl; make a well in
  the center. Pour water and egg yolk into the well and mix just until
  moistened; batter will be lumpy. Stir in egg whites.
</p>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Dip one shrimp at a time into batter to coat; do not batter tails. When three
  shrimp have been battered, carefully place them into the deep fryer and fry
  until golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain
  on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining shrimp, battering a few at
  a time while the previous batch is cooking.
