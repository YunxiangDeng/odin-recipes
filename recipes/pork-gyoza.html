<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Combine ground pork, cabbage, egg, spring onions, 1 tablespoon soy sauce,
  sake, mirin, and ginger in a large bowl; mix well.
</p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Place approximately 1 to 2 teaspoons of the pork mixture in the center of
  each gyoza wrapper. Moisten your fingers with water and rub around the edges
  of each wrapper. Fold wrappers in half over filling, creating a semi circle.
  Take one side of the wrapper and make crimps along the edges for a decorative
  pattern (like pleats of a skirt) and press along the edges to seal the two
  sides together. Ensure there isn't much excess air caught inside the dumpling.
  Repeat until all the pork mixture is used.
</p>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place as many
  gyoza in the skillet as fit in a single layer and fry until the bottom is
  browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add water to skillet and reduce heat. Cover and
  allow gyoza to steam until all the water has evaporated, about 5 minutes.
  Repeat with the remaining gyoza.
</p>
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Mix rice vinegar and soy sauce together for a dipping sauce and serve with
  the gyoza.
